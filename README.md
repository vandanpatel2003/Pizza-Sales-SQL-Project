# Pizza Sales SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL. The dataset contains information on orders, pizzas, customers, and other relevant details. The goal is to extract meaningful insights by performing various SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced levels.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following tables:
- **Orders**: Contains details about each order, including order ID, date, and time.
- **Order_Details**: Includes information on the pizzas ordered, quantity, and prices.
- **Pizzas**: Stores data on different types of pizzas, including size and category.
- **Pizza_Types**: Provides details such as pizza name, ingredients, and price.

## Analysis Categories
The project is divided into three levels of SQL analysis:

### 1. Basic Analysis
- Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
- Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
- Identify the highest-priced pizza.
- Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
- List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

### 2. Intermediate Analysis
- Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
- Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
- Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
- Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
- Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

### 3. Advanced Analysis
- Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
- Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
- Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

## Requirements
- SQL Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other SQL-based system)
- SQL Workbench or any preferred SQL IDE

## How to Use
1. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
2. Run the provided SQL queries to perform the analysis.
3. Modify or create new queries to explore additional insights.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a great exercise to enhance SQL skills by working with real-world sales data. By completing the different levels of analysis, you will gain a strong understanding of data retrieval, aggregation, and trend analysis using SQL.
